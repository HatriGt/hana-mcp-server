# HANA MCP Server Project Plan

## Project Overview

The HANA MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that enables AI assistants to interact with SAP HANA databases through natural language. This project aims to build a bridge between AI models and HANA databases, allowing for schema exploration, query execution, and system administration through a standardized protocol.

## Goals and Objectives

- Create a fully functional MCP server for SAP HANA databases
- Enable AI assistants to query and understand HANA database schemas
- Provide secure, read-only access to database content by default
- Support both local (STDIO) and remote (HTTP+SSE) connection methods
- Ensure proper error handling and security measures
- Deliver comprehensive documentation for users and contributors

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- Support for HANA authentication mechanisms
- Secure credential storage
- Role-based access control

### Data Protection
- Read-only access by default
- Query validation to prevent SQL injection
- Parameter binding for all user inputs

### Connection Security
- TLS encryption for database connections
- Secure transport options for MCP
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Configuration Options

The server will be configurable through environment variables or a configuration file:

```
# HANA Connection Settings
HANA_HOST=your-hana-host
HANA_PORT=30015
HANA_USER=your-username
HANA_PASSWORD=your-password
HANA_DATABASE=your-database
HANA_USE_TLS=true

# MCP Server Settings
MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio  # or "http"
MCP_PORT=3000        # only used if MCP_TRANSPORT=http

# Security Settings
ALLOW_WRITE_OPERATIONS=false  # set to true to allow data modification

# Logging Settings
LOG_LEVEL=info  # debug, info, warn, error
```

## Integration with AI Assistants

### Claude Desktop
Configuration example for Claude Desktop:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hana-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/hana-mcp-server/src/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "HANA_HOST": "your-hana-host",
        "HANA_PORT": "30015",
        "HANA_USER": "your-username",
        "HANA_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "HANA_DATABASE": "your-database"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor
Similar configuration can be used for Cursor's MCP settings.

| HANA client compatibility issues | High | Medium | Test with multiple versions, document requirements |
| MCP protocol changes | Medium | Low | Monitor protocol updates, design for adaptability |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Regular security reviews, follow best practices |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Implement pagination, optimize queries |

## Conclusion
